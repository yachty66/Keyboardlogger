# Python keystroke counter

## Description

This is an keystroke analyzer. The program counts the keystrokes of every key and the sum of all per day. Every Sunday I get an email with an overview from the past week. There are some secrete files which are not listed (keystroke log files, mailing script). You need to create your own files for successfully replicating the project.
